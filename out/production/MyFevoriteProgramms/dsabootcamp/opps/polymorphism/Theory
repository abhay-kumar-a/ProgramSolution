Polymorphism in Java
Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms.
So polymorphism means many forms.

There are two types of polymorphism in Java:
1_ compile-time polymorphism..
2_ runtime polymorphism.
We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.

If you overload a static method in Java, it is the example of compile time polymorphism. Here, we will focus on runtime polymorphism in java.

OverLoading:
If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading

Overriding:
If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding in Java.
