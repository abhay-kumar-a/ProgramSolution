// A class that can refer to any type is known as a generic class.
    // Here, we are using the T type parameter to create the generic class of specific type.
 // for genetics class use wrapper class because in generic method we can pass only reference types not primitives


   //  The T type indicates that it can refer to any type (like String, Integer, and Employee).
   //  The type you specify for the class will be used to store and retrieve the data.
