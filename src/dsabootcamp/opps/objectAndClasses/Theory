we will learn about Java objects and classes.
In object-oriented programming technique, we design a program using objects and classes.

Object and Java
An object in Java is the physical as well as a logical entity, whereas, a class in Java is a logical entity only.

.....................Object...............
What is an object in Java
object in Java:
An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object e.g., chair, bike, marker, pen, table, car, etc.
It can be physical or logical (tangible and intangible). The example of an intangible object is the banking system.

An object has three characteristics:
State: represents the data (value) of an object.
Behavior: represents the behavior (functionality) of an object such as deposit, withdraw, etc.
Identity: An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID. The value of the ID is not visible to the external user.
However, it is used internally by the JVM to identify each object uniquely.

For Example, Pen is an object. Its name is Reynolds; color is white, known as its state. It is used to write, so writing is its behavior.

An object is an instance of a class. A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. So, an object is the instance(result) of a class.

............................Classes ............................

A class is a group of objects which have common properties.
It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.
 It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.

A class in Java can contain:
Fields
Methods
Constructors
Blocks
Nested class and interface

..................Method..................
In general, a method is a way to perform some task.
Similarly, the method in Java is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task.
 It provides the reusability of code. We can also easily modify code using methods.



...................Constructor.............
In Java, a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method.
 It is called when an instance of the class is created.
 At the time of calling constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory.

 ........... static ...................

 The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly.
 We can apply static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes.
 The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.

 The static can be:

 Variable (also known as a class variable)
 Method (also known as a class method)
 Block
 Nested class

 ..................This keyword.................
 There can be a lot of usage of Java this keyword. In Java, this is a reference variable that refers to the current object.

 use of this

 this can be used to refer current class instance variable.
this can be used to invoke current class method (implicitly)
this() can be used to invoke current class constructor.
this can be passed as an argument in the method call.
this can be passed as argument in the constructor call.
this can be used to return the current class instance from the method.

 ............ super Keyword.......................
The super keyword in Java is a reference variable which is used to refer immediate parent class object.

Whenever you create the instance of subclass, an instance of parent class is created implicitly which is referred by super reference variable.

Usage of Java super Keyword
super can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.
super can be used to invoke immediate parent class method.
super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.

.................. final keyword......................
The final keyword in java is used to restrict the user. The java final keyword can be used in many context.
Final can be:
    variable
    method
    class
